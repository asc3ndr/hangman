# hangman
Basic Hangman game made for use in the terminal. Only tested on Linux and might have some issues with unicode and formatting in other systems.

First ever attempt at writing code in an object-oriented style - it's really messy code being honest.

It was a fun little project which taught me a lot about the object-oriented style and what NOT to do,
while being quite instructional.
